CIS 376 Project 1: Salon Booking App

This project is a Github Pages site where you may log in/out, book an appointment, and view portfolios for a salon.
My mother owns a salon, and I would like to take this experience to create a funcitoning or semi functional site for her to use, as she has no real website.

TODO:
- add files that the nav bar links to
- decided on all of my colors in dark mode while live viewing... cant see a thing normally

Known Issues:
2/3: header gradient is moving (fixed)
2/3: nav bar not functional
2/3: light mode color issue
